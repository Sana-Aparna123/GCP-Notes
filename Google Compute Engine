Google Compute Engine(Like EC2 in  aws):
----------------------------------------
In corporate data center,we deploy our applications in physical server.But in cloud we deploy applications in virtual servers.
*renting Virtual server-->called virtual machines
*In GCP we use Google Compute Engine(GCE) to provision(rent) and manage virtual machines.

Compute Engine-Features
-----------------------
*Create and Manage the life cycle of virtual machines(Vms) instances.(Create,stop,restart or terminate vms)
*We can use Load Balancers and Autoscaling to multiple VMs.
*Attach Storage(& Network Storage) to your VM instances(running os in harddisk and attaches to vm)
*Manage Network Connectivity and Configuration of your vm instances

Our Goal:
--------
Setup VM instances as HTTP(Web) Server.
Distribute Load with Load Balancers.


Task:
-------
1.creating an instance
2.connect to the SSH
3.run below commands in ssh:
sudo su-->go to root user
apt update 
apt install apache2
ls /var/www/html -->debian default root directory
echo "Hello World!"
echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html
echo $(hostname) -->print hostname or insance name
echo $(hostname -i) --->print host private ip(internal ip)
echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
echo "Hello World from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)"
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)" > /var/www/html/index.html
sudo service apache2 start




Internal(private) and External(public) ip for instance:
--------------------------------------------------------
*External ip addresses are Internet Addressable
*Internal ip addresses are internal only for corporate network
*you cannot have two resources with same external ip(public ip) addresses-->publish over internet
*but two different corporate networks can have same internal ip(private) address.
*By default when you create the instances,All vms assigned atleast one internal ip.
*Creation of external ip address can be enabled for vm instances.(when you stop an instance external ip address is lost).

Demo to see internal and external ip:when you start and stop the instance you can see the difference.


Static ip address:(External ip addresss option in VPC)
----------------------
How to get static external ip address for vm?

Demo:to enable static external ip to VM.

(note:ephemerel--changes,static--not change)

important points:
-----------
*Static ip is switched to another VM instance in same project.
*Static ip remains attached even if you stop the instance.you have to manually detached it.
note:you are billed for static ip when your not using well.
*if you dont want static ip release the static ip.



Simply VM HTTP server setup
-----------------------------
We can reduce the no of steps in creating an VM instance and setting up a HTTP server

1.Startup Script
2.Instance Template
3.Custom Image

1.Bootstraping with Startup Sacript

#!/bin/bash
apt update 
apt -y install apache2
echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html

Bootstraping:Install OS patches or software when VM is launched.
In VM you can configure Startup Sscript to Bootstrap
DEMO:Using Startup script-->while creating instance go to Advance Options-->Management-->Automation-->paste the script in text box.


2.Instance Templates

Why do you need to specify all the VM instance details(Image,instance type etc.) every time you launch an instance?
   *How about creating a instance template?
   *Define machine type,image,labels,startup script and other properties.
   
Used to create VM instances and managed instance groups
  *Provides convinient way to create similar instances
  
  
Cannot be updated
  *To make change,Copy on existing template and modify it.
  
  
 Image family can be specified(example-Debian-9)
   *Latest non-deprecated version of family is used
   
Demo:Launch VM instance using Instance Template

Reducing Launch Time with Custom images
----------------------------------------
Installing OS patches and software at launch of Vm instances increases the bootup time.

How about creating an custom image with Os patches and softwares pre-sinstalled?
   *Can be created from an instance,a persistent disk,a snapshot,another image,or a file in Cloud Storage.
   *you can share custom image through across project
   *whenever you created an image if it not used over a period of time if you dont want you can mark as an deprecated old image and create
   an new image specify recommended new image.
   *Hardening an image--->create an image which follows the corporate security standards.Once you have an hardening image you can 
   create secure VM instances.
   
prefer using custom image to startup script(Startup increase the bootup time).

DEMO:Create an custom image and using it in an instance Template.
Note:You never create an image from disks of running instance.(Stop the instance and create).

step:
#creating an custom image using disks and used that custom image by creating an VM instance directly or with the help of custom image we can create template instance and using that template instance we can create VM instance
 

Trouble Shooting of Launch of Apache on GCP Virtual Machine
--------------------------------------------------------
When you launch an instance and trying to access the external ip if it not working.what are the steps that has to be taken.
*click on external ip its wrking or not.
*if external ip si not loading check the HTTP traffic is configured in VM or not.
*click the SSH if SSh is open properly so that apache server is working
*check the root file is present (SSH)--->ls /var/www/html
*check that root file content (SSH)---->cat /var/www/html/index.html
*if content is there in that and start the apache service to work.

Google-Compute(Optimising Cost and Performance in GCP)
-----------------------------------------------------

Sustained used discounts:
----------------------

*Automatic discounts for VM instances for significat portion of billing month.
*it is applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine
Note-->#Does not apply on certain machine types(Ex:E2 and A2)
       #Does not apply to the VMs created by App Engine Flexible and data flow.
       
Commited used discounts:(Reserved instances in aws)
-----------------------

*For workloads with predictable resource needs
*Commit for 1 or 3 years(if you can puchase vm for 1 year or 3 years depending on your requirement)
*Upto 70 % discount based on machine type and GPUs
*it is applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine
Note-->#Does not apply to the VMs created by App Engine Flexible and data flow.

Preemptible VMs:-->24 hours vm 
------------------
*Short-lived Cheaper(upto 80%) compute instances
   #Can be stopped by GCP any time(preempted) within 24 hours.
   #Instances get 30 second warning(to save anything they want to save)
   
*Use Preempt VMs if:
   #your applications are fault tolerant(you stop and start vm any point of time).
   #you are very cost sensitive.
   #your workload is not immediate(Ex:non immediate batch processing jobs)
   Note: not availabe always,no SLA cannot be migrated to regular Vms,No automatic restart,Free tier credits not applicable.
   
*preemptible Vms are similar to spot instances.
 
where it is?-->when you configure an instance you will have an option Advaced details-->Management-->Availability Policy-->Preemptiiblity
(these Vm is not in free tier)


Spot Vms:
---------
*Latest version of preemptible VMs
*Spot Vms doesn't have maximum runtime
  #compare to traditional preemptible Vms which have an maximum runtime 24 hours.
  
*Other features are similar like preemptible VMs.
  #May be reclaimed at any time with 30-second notice.
  #Not always availabe
  #Dynamic-Pricing:60-91% discount compared to on demand VMS.
  #Free tier credits not applicable.
  
*Spot Vms is only terminated when compute Engine needs the resources elsewhere


Live Migration And Availability policy:
-----------------------------------
*while keeping the instance running.so on time host system need to be updated.(a software or hardware update is needs to be performed).
*Live Migration:
      #your running instance is migrated to another host in same zone.
      #It doesn't change any attributes and properties of VM.
      #Supported for instances even having local SSDs.
      #Not Supported for GPUs and preemptible instances.
      
*Availability policy:-->important Configuration
    #On host maintainence:what should happen during periodic insfrastructure maintenance?
       ->Migrate(default):Migrate VM instance to other hardware
       ->Terminate:Stop the VM instance.
    #Automatic restart:Restart instances if they are terminated due to non-user initiated reasons(maintenence event,hardware failures etc.)
       
    	

Custom Machine Type:
--------------------
*When predefined VM options are not suitable for our workload so we can create "custom machine Type".
*With the help of Custom Machine Type you can choose vCPUs,memory and GPUs.
    #choose between E2,N2 or N1 machine types
    #Supports a wide variety of operating Systems:CentOs,CoreOs,Debian,Red hat,Ubuntu,Windows etc.
*if you choose an custom image type you can billed only for vCPUs,memory provisioned to each instance.


Graphic Processing Unit(GPUS):
------------------------------
if you want to accelerate the math intensive and graph intensive workloads for AI/ML GPUs is used.


Scenarios and Solutions:
------------------------
Scenario1:
what are the prerequisites to be able to create a VM instance?
solution:
1.Project
2.Billing Account
3.Compute ENgine APIs shouble be enabled

Scenario2:
If you want dedicated hardware for your compliance,licensing and management needs(entire hardware to create VMS)
solution:
Sole-tenant nodes option in Compute Engine.
