Google Storage Concepts:
--------------------------
*harddisk storage type--->Block Storage
*File created and share on network--->File Storage

Block Storage:
------------
*harddisk attaches to computer
  1.only one block storage can be connected to  one VM.(traditional way)
  2.if you only read only block storage devices so yoy can attach it to the multiple VMs.
  
*However you can connect multiple different block storage devices to one VM

Used as:

* Direct-attached storage (DAS) - Similar to a hard disk
* Storage Area Network (SAN) - High-speed network connecting a pool of storage devices
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
persistant disks:
-------------------
three types:
1.standard-->HDD-->pd-standard-->good for big data/batch processing and not good for transaction apps-->cheap
2.Balanced-->SSD-->pd-balanced-->good for big data/batch processing and  good for transaction apps-->some cost than standard
3.SSD-->pd-SSD-->very good for big data/batch processing and very good for transaction apps-->very expensive



Persistent Disks - Snapshots
--------------------------------

* Take point-in-time snapshots of your Persistent Disks

* You can also schedule snapshots (configure a schedule):

■ You can also auto-delete snapshots after X days

* Snapshots can be Multi-regional and Regional

* You can share snapshots across projects

* You can create new disks and instances from snapshots

* Snapshots are incremental:

■ Deleting a snapshot only deletes data which is NOT needed by other snapshots

* Keep similar data together on a Persistent Disk:

■ Separate your operating system, volatile data and permanent data

■ Attach multiple disks if needed

■ This helps to better organize your snapshots and images

Persistent Disks - Snapshots - Recommendations
---------------------------------------------

* Avoid taking snapshots more often than once an hour

* Disk volume is available for use but Snapshots reduce performance

■ (RECOMMENDED) Schedule snapshots during off-peak hours

* Creating snapshots from disk is faster than creating from images:

■ But creating disks from image is faster than creating from snapshots

■ (RECOMMENDED) If you are repeatedly creating disks from a snapshot:

* Create an image from snapshot and use the image to create disks

* Snapshots are incremental:

■ BUT you don't lose data by deleting older snapshots

■ Deleting a snapshot only deletes data which is NOT needed by other snapshots

■ (RECOMMENDED) Do not hesitate to delete unnecessary snapshots


playing with machine image:
--------------------------------

* (Remember) Machine Image is different from Image

* Multiple disks can be attached with a VM:

■ One Boot Disk (Your OS runs from Boot Disk)

■ Multiple Data Disks

* An image is created from the boot Persistent Disk

* HOWEVER, a Machine Image is created from a VM instance:

■ Machine Image contains everything you need to create a VM instance:

* Configuration

* Metadata

* Permissions

* Data from one or more disks

 **Recommended data backups,instance cloning and replication.
